  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Genome-wide haplotype reconstruction from sequence data, or haplotype assembly, is at the center of major challenges in molecular biology and life sciences. For complex eukaryotic organisms like humans, the genome is vast and the population samples are growing so rapidly that algorithms processing high-throughput sequencing data must scale favorably in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, current models and methodologies for haplotype assembly (i) do not consider individuals sharing haplotypes jointly, which reduces the size and accuracy of assembled haplotypes, and (ii) are unable to model genomes having more than two sets of homologous chromosomes (polyploidy). Polyploid organisms are increasingly becoming the target of many research groups interested in the genomics of disease, phylogenetics, botany and evolution but there is an absence of theory and methods for polyploid haplotype reconstruction. Results: In this work, we present a number of results, extensions and generalizations of compass graphs and our {HapCompass} framework. We prove the theoretical complexity of two haplotype assembly optimizations, thereby motivating the use of heuristics. Furthermore, we present graph theoryâbased algorithms for the problem of haplotype assembly using our previously developed {HapCompass} framework for (i) novel implementations of haplotype assembly optimizations (minimum error correction), (ii) assembly of a pair of individuals sharing a haplotype tract identical by descent and (iii) assembly of polyploid genomes. We evaluate our methods on 1000 Genomes Project, Pacific Biosciences and simulated sequence data.

  Abstract                 = {Genetic variations predispose individuals to hereditary diseases, play important role in the development of complex diseases, and impact drug metabolism. The full information about the DNA variations in the genome of an individual is given by haplotypes, the ordered lists of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on chromosomes. Affordable high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies enable routine acquisition of data needed for the assembly of single individual haplotypes. However, state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing platforms generate data that is erroneous, which induces uncertainty in the SNP and genotype calling procedures and, ultimately, adversely affect the accuracy of haplotyping. When inferring haplotype phase information, the vast majority of the existing techniques for haplotype assembly assume that the genotype information is correct. This motivates the development of methods capable of joint genotype calling and haplotype assembly.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: The goal of the haplotype assembly problem is to reconstruct the two haplotypes (chromosomes) for an individual using a mix of sequenced fragments from the two chromosomes. This problem has been shown to be computationally intractable for various optimization criteria. Polynomial time algorithms have been proposed for restricted versions of the problem. In this article, we consider the haplotype assembly problem in the most general setting, i.e. fragments of any length and with an arbitrary number of gaps.
Results: We describe a novel combinatorial approach for the haplotype assembly problem based on computing max-cuts in certain graphs derived from the sequenced fragments. Levy et al. have sequenced the complete genome of a human individual and used a greedy heuristic to assemble the haplotypes for this individual. We have applied our method HapCUTto infer haplotypes from this data and demonstrate that the haplotypes inferred using HapCUT are significantly more accurate (20â25\% lower maximum error correction scores for all chromosomes) than the greedy heuristic and a previously published method, Fast Hare. We also describe a maximum likelihood based estimator of the absolute accuracy of the sequence-based haplotypes using population haplotypes from the International HapMap project.
Availability: A program implementing HapCUT is available on request.

  Abstract                 = {Author SummaryWhile human and other eukaryotic genomes typically contain two copies of every chromosome, plants, yeast and fish such as salmon can have strictly more than two copies of each chromosome. By running standard genotype calling tools, it is possible to accurately identify the number of âwild typeâ and âmutantâ alleles (A, C, G, or T) for each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site. However, in the case of two heterozygous SNP sites, genotype calling tools cannot determine whether âmutantâ alleles from different SNP loci are on the same or different chromosomes. While the former would be healthy, in many cases the latter can cause loss of function; it is therefore necessary to identify the phaseâthe copies of a chromosome on which the mutant alleles occurâin addition to the genotype. This necessitates efficient algorithms to obtain accurate and comprehensive phase information directly from the next-generation-sequencing read data in higher ploidy species. We introduce an efficient statistical method for this task and show that our method significantly outperforms previous ones, in both accuracy and speed, for phasing triploid and higher ploidy genomes. Our method performs well on human diploid genomes as well, as demonstrated by our improved phasing of the well known NA12878 (1000 Genomes Project).},

  Abstract                 = {Haplotype assembly is the computational problem of reconstructing the two parental copies, called haplotypes, of each chromosome starting from sequencing reads, called fragments, possibly affected by sequencing errors. Minimum Error Correction (MEC) is a prominent computational problem for haplotype assembly and, given a set of fragments, aims at reconstructing the two haplotypes by applying the minimum number of base corrections. By using novel combinatorial properties of MEC instances, we are able to provide new results on the fixed-parameter tractability and approximability of MEC. In particular, we show that MEC is in FPT when parameterized by the number of corrections, and, on âgaplessâ instances, it is in FPT also when parameterized by the length of the fragments, whereas the result known in literature forces the reconstruction of complementary haplotypes. Then, we show that MEC cannot be approximated within any constant factor while it is approximable within factor O(lognm)O({\textbackslash}log nm) where nmn m is the size of the input. Finally, we provide a practical 2-approximation algorithm for the Binary MEC, a variant of MEC that has been applied in the framework of clustering binary data.},

Our method employs the computationally efficient {BEAGLE} haplotype-frequency model, which can be applied to large-scale studies with millions of markers and thousands ofÂ samples. We compare genotype calls made with our method to genotype calls made with the {BIRDSEED}, {CHIAMO}, {GenCall}, and {ILLUMINUS} genotype-calling methods, using genotype data from the Illumina 550K and Affymetrix 500K arrays. We show that our method has higher genotype-call accuracy and yields fewer uncalled genotypes than competing methods. We perform single-marker analysis of data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium bipolar disorder and type 2 diabetes studies. For bipolar disorder, the genotype calls in the original study yield 25 markers with apparent false-positive association with bipolar disorder at a p {\textless} 10â7 significance level, whereas genotype calls made with our method yield no associated markers at this significance threshold. Conversely, for markers with replicated association with type 2 diabetes, there is good concordance between genotype calls used in the original study and calls made by our method. Results from single-marker and haplotypic analysis of our method's genotype calls for the bipolar disorder study indicate that our method is highly effective at eliminating genotyping artifacts that cause false-positive associations in genome-wide association studies. Our new genotype-calling methods are implemented in the {BEAGLE} and {BEAGLECALL} software packages.},

  Abstract                 = {Emerging sequencing technologies allow common and rare variants to be systematically assayed across the human genome in many individuals. In order to improve variant detection and genotype calling, raw sequence data are typically examined across many individuals. Here, we describe a method for genotype calling in settings where sequence data are available for unrelated individuals and parent-offspring trios and show that modeling trio information can greatly increase the accuracy of inferred genotypes and haplotypes, especially on low to modest depth sequencing data. Our method considers both linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and the constraints imposed by family structure when assigning individual genotypes and haplotypes. Using simulations, we show that trios provide higher genotype calling accuracy across the frequency spectrum, both overall and at hard-to-call heterozygous sites. In addition, trios provide greatly improved phasing accuracy--improving the accuracy of downstream analyses (such as genotype imputation) that rely on phased haplotypes. To further evaluate our approach, we analyzed data on the first 508 individuals sequenced by the SardiNIA sequencing project. Our results show that our method reduces the genotyping error rate by 50\% compared with analysis using existing methods that ignore family structure. We anticipate our method will facilitate genotype calling and haplotype inference for many ongoing sequencing projects.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Haplotypes play a crucial role in genetic analysis and have many applications such as gene disease diagnoses, association studies, ancestry inference and so forth. The development of {DNA} sequencing technologies makes it possible to obtain haplotypes from a set of aligned reads originated from both copies of a chromosome of a single individual. This approach is often known as haplotype assembly. Exact algorithms that can give optimal solutions to the haplotype assembly problem are highly demanded. Unfortunately, previous algorithms for this problem either fail to output optimal solutions or take too long time even executed on a {PC} cluster. Results: We develop an approach to finding optimal solutions for the haplotype assembly problem under the minimum-error-correction ({MEC}) model. Most of the previous approaches assume that the columns in the input matrix correspond to (putative) heterozygous sites. This all-heterozygous assumption is correct for most columns, but it may be incorrect for a small number of columns. In this article, we consider the {MEC} model with or without the all-heterozygous assumption. In our approach, we first use new methods to decompose the input read matrix into small independent blocks and then model the problem for each block as an integer linear programming problem, which is then solved by an integer linear programming solver. We have tested our program on a single {PC} [a Linux (x64) desktop {PC} with i7-3960X {CPU}], using the filtered {HuRef} and the {NA} 12878 datasets (after applying some variant calling methods). With the all-heterozygous assumption, our approach can optimally solve the whole {HuRef} data set within a total time of 31 h (26 h for the most difficult block of the 15th chromosome and only 5 h for the other blocks). To our knowledge, this is the first time that {MEC} optimal solutions are completely obtained for the filtered {HuRef} dataset. Moreover, in the general case (without the all-heterozygous assumption), for the {HuRef} dataset our approach can optimally solve all the chromosomes except the most difficult block in chromosome 15 within a total time of 12 days. For both of the {HuRef} and {NA}12878 datasets, the optimal costs in the general case are sometimes much smaller than those in the all-heterozygous case. This implies that some columns in the input matrix (after applying certain variant calling methods) still correspond to false-heterozygous sites.

Specifically, we look at the gapless case, where every row of the input corresponds to a gapless haplotype-fragment, and the 1-gap case, where at most one gap per fragment is allowed. We prove that MEC is APX-hard in the 1-gap case and still NP-hard in the gapless case. In addition, we question earlier claims that MEC is NP-hard even when the input matrix is restricted to being completely binary. Concerning LHR, we show that this problem is NP-hard and APX-hard in the 1-gap case (and thus also in the general case), but is polynomial time solvable in the gapless case.},

  Abstract                 = {High-throughput sequencing technologies produce short sequence reads that can contain phase information if they span two or more heterozygote genotypes. This information is not routinely used by current methods that infer haplotypes from genotype data. We have extended the {SHAPEIT}2 method to use phase-informative sequencing reads to improve phasing accuracy. Our model incorporates the read information in a probabilistic model through base quality scores within each read. The method is primarily designed for high-coverage sequence data or data sets that already have genotypes called. One important application is phasing of single samples sequenced at high coverage for use in medical sequencing and studies of rare diseases. Our method can also use existing panels of reference haplotypes. We tested the method by using a mother-father-child trio sequenced at high-coverage by Illumina together with the low-coverage sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP). We found that use of phase-informative reads increases the mean distance between switch errors by 22\% from 274.4 kb to 328.6 kb. We also used male chromosome X haplotypes from the 1000GP samples to simulate sequencing reads with varying insert size, read length, and base error rate. When using short 100Â bp paired-end reads, we found that using mixtures of insert sizes produced the best results. When using longer reads with high error rates (5â20 kb read with 4\%â15\% error per base), phasing performance was substantially improved.},

  Abstract                 = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) are the most common form of genetic variation in human {DNA}. The sequence of {SNPs} in each of the two copies of a given chromosome in a diploid organism is referred to as a haplotype. Haplotype information has many applications such as gene disease diagnoses, drug design, etc. The haplotype assembly problem is defined as follows: Given a set of fragments sequenced from the two copies of a chromosome of a single individual, and their locations in the chromosome, which can be pre-determined by aligning the fragments to a reference {DNA} sequence, the goal here is to reconstruct two haplotypes (h1, h2) from the input fragments. Existing algorithms do not work well when the error rate of fragments is high. Here we design an algorithm that can give accurate solutions, even if the error rate of fragments is high. {PMID}: 23445458},

  Abstract                 = {Full human genomic sequences have been published in the latest two years for a growing number of individuals. Most of them are a mixed consensus of the two real haplotypes because it is still very expensive to separate information coming from the two copies of a chromosome. However, latest improvements and new experimental approaches promise to solve these issues and provide enough information to reconstruct the sequences for the two copies of each chromosome through bioinformatics methods such as single individual haplotyping. Full haploid sequences provide a complete understanding of the structure of the human genome, allowing accurate predictions of translation in protein coding regions and increasing power of association studies. In this paper we present a novel problem formulation for single individual haplotyping. We start by assigning a score to each pair of fragments based on their common allele calls and then we use these score to formulate the problem as the cut of fragments that maximize an objective function, similar to the well known max-cut problem. Our algorithm initially finds the best cut based on a heuristic algorithm for max-cut and then builds haplotypes consistent with that cut. We have compared both accuracy and running time of {ReFHap} with other heuristic methods on both simulated and real data and found that {ReFHap} performs significantly faster than previous methods without loss of accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Haplotype inference is an important step for many types of analyses of genetic variation in the human genome. Traditional approaches for obtaining haplotypes involve collecting genotype information from a population of individuals and then applying a haplotype inference algorithm. The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies allows for an alternative strategy to obtain haplotypes by combining sequence fragments. The problem of âhaplotype assemblyâ is the problem of assembling the two haplotypes for a chromosome given the collection of such fragments, or reads, and their locations in the haplotypes, which are pre-determined by mapping the reads to a reference genome. Errors in reads significantly increase the difficulty of the problem and it has been shown that the problem is {NP}-hard even for reads of length 2. Existing greedy and stochastic algorithms are not guaranteed to find the optimal solutions for the haplotype assembly problem. Results: In this article, we proposed a dynamic programming algorithm that is able to assemble the haplotypes optimally with time complexity O(m Ã 2k Ã n), where m is the number of reads, k is the length of the longest read and n is the total number of {SNPs} in the haplotypes. We also reduce the haplotype assembly problem into the maximum satisfiability problem that can often be solved optimally even when k is large. Taking advantage of the efficiency of our algorithm, we perform simulation experiments demonstrating that the assembly of haplotypes using reads of length typical of the current sequencing technologies is not practical. However, we demonstrate that the combination of this approach and the traditional haplotype phasing approaches allow us to practically construct haplotypes containing both common and rare variants.

  Abstract                 = {Inference of haplotypes, or the sequence of alleles along each chromosome, is a fundamental problem in genetics and is important for many analyses, including admixture mapping, identifying regions of identity by descent, and imputation. Traditionally, haplotypes are inferred from genotype data obtained from microarrays using information on population haplotype frequencies inferred from either a large sample of genotyped individuals or a reference dataset such as the {HapMap}. Since the availability of large reference datasets, modern approaches for haplotype phasing along these lines are closely related to imputation methods. When applied to data obtained from sequencing studies, a straightforward way to obtain haplotypes is to first infer genotypes from the sequence data and then apply an imputation method. However, this approach does not take into account that alleles on the same sequence read originate from the same chromosome. Haplotype assembly approaches take advantage of this insight and predict haplotypes by assigning the reads to chromosomes in such a way that minimizes the number of conflicts between the reads and the predicted haplotypes. Unfortunately, assembly approaches require very high sequencing coverage and are usually not able to fully reconstruct the haplotypes. In this work, we present a novel approach, Hap-seq, which is simultaneously an imputation and assembly method that combines information from a reference dataset with the information from the reads using a likelihood framework. Our method applies a dynamic programming algorithm to identify the predicted haplotype, which maximizes the joint likelihood of the haplotype with respect to the reference dataset and the haplotype with respect to the observed reads. We show that our method requires only low sequencing coverage and can reconstruct haplotypes containing both common and rare alleles with higher accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art imputation methods.},

This problem has only recently started to become tractable, thanks to the development of new long read sequencing technologies. Here, we introduce {ProbHap}, a haplotyping algorithm targeted at such technologies. The main algorithmic idea of {ProbHap} is a new dynamic programming algorithm that exactly optimizes a likelihood function specified by a probabilistic graphical model and which generalizes a popular objective called the minimum error correction. In addition to being accurate, {ProbHap} also provides confidence scores at phased positions. Results: On a standard benchmark dataset, {ProbHap} makes 11\% fewer errors than current state-of-the-art methods. This accuracy can be further increased by excluding low-confidence positions, at the cost of a small drop in haplotype completeness.

  Abstract                 = {The rapid growth of sequencing technologies has greatly contributed to our understanding of human genetics. Yet, despite this growth, mainstream technologies have not been fully able to resolve the diploid nature of the human genome. Here we describe statistically aided, long-read haplotyping ({SLRH}), a rapid, accurate method that uses a statistical algorithm to take advantage of the partially phased information contained in long genomic fragments analyzed by short-read sequencing. For a human sample, as little as 30 Gbp of additional sequencing data are needed to phase genotypes identified by 50Ã coverage whole-genome sequencing. Using {SLRH}, we phase 99\% of single-nucleotide variants in three human genomes into long haplotype blocks 0.2â1 Mbp in length. We apply our method to determine allele-specific methylation patterns in a human genome and identify hundreds of differentially methylated regions that were previously unknown. {SLRH} should facilitate population-scale haplotyping of human genomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) are the most frequent form of human genetic variation. They are of fundamental importance for a variety of applications including medical diagnostic and drug design. They also provide the highest-resolution genomic fingerprint for tracking disease genes. This paper is devoted to algorithmic problems related to computational {SNPs} validation based on genome assembly of diploid organisms. In diploid genomes, there are two copies of each chromosome. A description of the {SNPs} sequence information from one of the two chromosomes is called {SNPs} haplotype. The basic problem addressed here is the Haplotyping, i.e., given a set of {SNPs} prospects inferred from the assembly alignment of a genomic region of a chromosome, find the maximally consistent pair of {SNPs} haplotypes by removing data âerrorsâ related to {DNA} sequencing errors, repeats, and paralogous recruitment. In this paper, we introduce several versions of the problem from a computational point of view. We show that the general {SNPs} Haplotyping Problem is {NP}-hard for mate-pairs assembly data, and design polynomial time algorithms for fragment assembly data. We give a network-flow based polynomial algorithm for the Minimum Fragment Removal Problem, and we show that the Minimum {SNPs} Removal problem amounts to finding the largest independent set in a weakly triangulated graph.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge of haplotype phase is valuable for many analysis methods in the study of disease, population, and evolutionary genetics. Considerable research effort has been devoted to the development of statistical and computational methods that infer haplotype phase from genotype data. Although a substantial number of such methods have been developed, they have focused principally on inference from unrelated individuals, and comparisons between methods have been rather limited. Here, we describe the extension of five leading algorithms for phase inference for handling father-mother-child trios. We performed a comprehensive assessment of the methods applied to both trios and to unrelated individuals, with a focus on genomic-scale problems, using both simulated data and data from the {HapMap} project. The most accurate algorithm was {PHASE} (v2.1). For this method, the percentages of genotypes whose phase was incorrectly inferred were 0.12\%, 0.05\%, and 0.16\% for trios from simulated data, {HapMap} Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain ({CEPH}) trios, and {HapMap} Yoruban trios, respectively, and 5.2\% and 5.9\% for unrelated individuals in simulated data and the {HapMap} {CEPH} data, respectively. The other methods considered in this work had comparable but slightly worse error rates. The error rates for trios are similar to the levels of genotyping error and missing data expected. We thus conclude that all the methods considered will provide highly accurate estimates of haplotypes when applied to trio data sets. Running times differ substantially between methods. Although it is one of the slowest methods, {PHASE} (v2.1) was used to infer haplotypes for the 1 millionâ{SNP} {HapMap} data set. Finally, we evaluated methods of estimating the value of r2 between a pair of {SNPs} and concluded that all methods estimated r2 well when the estimated value was â©Ÿ0.8.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Understanding exact structure of an individualâs haplotype plays a significant role in various fields of human genetics. Despite tremendous research effort in recent years, fast and accurate haplotype reconstruction remains as an active research topic, mainly owing to the computational challenges involved. Existing haplotype assembly algorithms focus primarily on improving accuracy of the assembly, making them computationally challenging for applications on large high-throughput sequence data. Therefore, there is a need to develop haplotype reconstruction algorithms that are not only accurate but also highly scalable. Results: In this article, we introduce {FastHap}, a fast and accurate haplotype reconstruction approach, which is up to one order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art haplotype inference algorithms while also delivering higher accuracy than these algorithms. {FastHap} leverages a new similarity metric that allows us to precisely measure distances between pairs of fragments. The distance is then used in building the fuzzy conflict graphs of fragments. Given that optimal haplotype reconstruction based on minimum error correction is known to be {NP}-hard, we use our fuzzy conflict graphs to develop a fast heuristic for fragment partitioning and haplotype reconstruction.

  Abstract                 = {Author Summary Every individual carries two copies of each chromosome (haplotypes), one from each of their parents, that consist of a long sequence of alleles. Modern genotyping technologies do not measure haplotypes directly, but the combined sum (or genotype) of alleles at each site. Statistical methods are needed to infer (or phase) the haplotypes from the observed genotypes. Haplotype estimation is a key first step of many disease and population genetic studies. Much recent work in this area has focused on phasing in cohorts of nominally unrelated individuals. So called âlong range phasingâ is a relatively recent concept for phasing individuals with intermediate levels of relatedness, such as cohorts taken from population isolates. Methods also exist for phasing genotypes for individuals within explicit pedigrees. Whilst high quality phasing techniques are available for each of these demographic scenarios, to date, no single method is applicable to all three. In this paper, we present a general approach for phasing cohorts that contain any level of relatedness between the study individuals. We demonstrate high levels of accuracy in all demographic scenarios, as well as the ability to detect (Mendelian consistent) genotyping error and recombination events in duos and trios, the first method with such a capability.},

Haplotype assembly, which addresses phasing directly from sequencing reads, suffers from the fact that sequencing reads of the current generation are too short to serve the purposes of genome-wide phasing. While future-technology sequencing reads will contain sufficient amounts of SNPs per read for phasing, they are also likely to suffer from higher sequencing error rates. Currently, no haplotype assembly approaches exist that allow for taking both increasing read length and sequencing error information into account. Here, we suggest WhatsHap, the first approach that yields provably optimal solutions to the weighted minimum error correction problem in runtime linear in the number of SNPs. WhatsHap is a fixed parameter tractable (FPT) approach with coverage as the parameter. We demonstrate that WhatsHap can handle datasets of coverage up to 20Ã, and that 15Ã are generally enough for reliably phasing long reads, even at significantly elevated sequencing error rates. We also find that the switch and flip error rates of the haplotypes we output are favorable when comparing them with state-of-the-art statistical phasers.},

  Abstract                 = {The human genome is diploid, that is each of its chromosomes comes in two copies. This requires to phase the single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}), that is, to assign them to the two copies, beyond just detecting them. The resulting haplotypes, lists of {SNPs} belonging to each copy, are crucial for downstream analyses in population genetics. Currently, statistical approaches, which avoid making use of direct read information, constitute the state-of-the-art. Haplotype assembly, which addresses phasing directly from sequencing reads, suffers from the fact that sequencing reads of the current generation are too short to serve the purposes of genome-wide phasing. Future sequencing technologies, however, bear the promise to generate reads of lengths and error rates that allow to bridge all {SNP} positions in the genome at sufficient amounts of {SNPs} per read. Existing haplotype assembly approaches, however, profit precisely, in terms of computational complexity, from the limited length of current-generation reads, because their runtime is usually exponential in the number of {SNPs} per sequencing read. This implies that such approaches will not be able to exploit the benefits of long enough, future-generation reads. Here, we suggest {WhatsHap}, a novel dynamic programming approach to haplotype assembly. It is the first approach that yields provably optimal solutions to the weighted minimum error correction ({wMEC}) problem in runtime linear in the number of {SNPs} per sequencing read, making it suitable for future-generation reads. {WhatsHap} is a fixed parameter tractable ({FPT}) approach with coverage as the parameter. We demonstrate that {WhatsHap} can handle datasets of coverage up to 20x, processing chromosomes on standard workstations in only 1-2 hours. Our simulation study shows that the quality of haplotypes assembled by {WhatsHap} significantly improves with increasing read length, both in terms of genome coverage as well as in terms of switch errors. The switch error rates we achieve in our simulations are superior to those obtained by state-of-the-art statistical phasers.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the first comprehensive analysis of a diploid human genome that combines single-molecule sequencing with single-molecule genome maps. Our hybrid assembly markedly improves upon the contiguity observed from traditional shotgun sequencing approaches, with scaffold N50 values approaching 30 Mb, and we identified complex structural variants (SVs) missed by other high-throughput approaches. Furthermore, by combining Illumina short-read data with long reads, we phased both single-nucleotide variants and SVs, generating haplotypes with over 99\% consistency with previous trio-based studies. Our work shows that it is now possible to integrate single-molecule and high-throughput sequence data to generate de novo assembled genomes that approach reference quality.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Haplotype assembly is the computational problem of reconstructing haplotypes in diploid organisms and is of fundamental importance for characterizing the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the expression of phenotypic traits. Haplotype assembly highly benefits from the advent of âfuture-generationâ sequencing technologies and their capability to produce long reads at increasing coverage. Existing methods are not able to deal with such data in a fully satisfactory way, either because accuracy or performances degrade as read length and sequencing coverage increase or because they are based on restrictive assumptions.
Results: By exploiting a feature of future-generation technologiesâthe uniform distribution of sequencing errorsâwe designed an exact algorithm, called HapCol, that is exponential in the maximum number of corrections for each single-nucleotide polymorphism position and that minimizes the overall error-correction score. We performed an experimental analysis, comparing HapCol with the current state-of-the-art combinatorial methods both on real and simulated data. On a standard benchmark of real data, we show that HapCol is competitive with state-of-the-art methods, improving the accuracy and the number of phased positions. Furthermore, experiments on realistically simulated datasets revealed that HapCol requires significantly less computing resources, especially memory. Thanks to its computational efficiency, HapCol can overcome the limits of previous approaches, allowing to phase datasets with higher coverage and without the traditional all-heterozygous assumption.

  Abstract                 = {Genome-wide association studies have expanded our understanding of the relationship between the human genome and disease. However, because of current technical limitations, it is still challenging to clearly resolve diploid sequences, that is, two copies for each chromosome. One copy of each chromosome is inherited from each parent and the genomic function is determined by the interplay between the alleles represented as genotypes in the diploid sequences. Thus, to understand the nature of genetic variation in biological processes, including disease, it is necessary to determine the complete genomic sequence of each haplotype. Although there are experimental approaches for haplotype sequencing that physically separate the chromosomes, these methods are expensive and laborious and require special equipment. Here, we review the computational approaches that can be used to determine the haplotype phase. Since 1990, many researchers have tried to reconstruct the haplotype phase using a variety of computational methods, and some researches have been successfully help to determine the haplotype phase. In this review, we investigate how the computational haplotype determination methods have been developed, and we present the remaining problems affecting the determination of the haplotype of single individual using next-generation sequencing methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Genome sequencing studies to date have generally sought to assemble consensus genomes by merging sequence contributions from multiple homologous copies of each chromosome. With growing interest in genetic variations, however, there is a need for methods to separate these distinct contributions and assess how individual homologous chromosome copies differ from one another. An approach to this problem was developed using small sequence fragments derived from shotgun sequencing studies to determine the patterns of variations that co-occur on individual chromosomes. This has become known as the "haplotype assembly" problem. This review paper surveys results on the theory and algorithms for haplotype assembly. It first describes common abstractions of the problem. It then discusses some notable intractibility results for different problem variants. It next examines a variety of combinatorial, statistical, and heuristic methods for assembling fragment data sets in practice. The review concludes with a discussion of recent directions in diploid genome sequencing and their implications for haplotype assembly in the future.},

Here, we review emerging technologies for experimentally resolving (that is, 'phasing') haplotypes across individual whole-genome sequences. We also discuss computational methods relevant to their implementation, metrics for assessing their accuracy and completeness, and the relevance of haplotype information to applications of genome sequencing in research and clinical medicine.},

The variation data are sought in order to address fundamental and applied questions in genetics that concern the haplotypes in the population. Since, almost all the collected data is in the form of genotypes, but the downstream genetics questions concern haplotypes, the standard approach to this issue has been to try to first infer haplotypes from the genotypes, and then answer the downstream questions using the inferred haplotypes. That two-stage approach has potential deficiencies, giving rise to the general question of how well one can answer the downstream questions using genotype data without first inferring haplotypes, and giving rise to the goal of computing the range of downstream answers that would be obtained over the range of possible inferred haplotype solutions. This paper provides some tools for the study of those issues, and some partial answers. We present algorithms to solve downstream questions concerning the minimum amount of recombination needed to derive given genotypic data, without first fixing a choice of haplotypes. We apply these algorithms to the goal of finding recombination hotspots, obtaining as good results as a published method that first infers haplotypes; and to the case of estimating the minimum amount of recombination needed to derive the true haplotypes underlying the genotypic data, obtaining weaker results compared to first inferring haplotypes using the program PHASE.},

  Abstract                 = {Haplotype phasing represents an essential step in studying the association of genomic polymorphisms with complex genetic diseases, and in determining targets for drug designing. In recent years, huge amounts of genotype data are produced from the rapidly evolving high-throughput sequencing technologies, and the data volume challenges the community with more efficient haplotype phasing algorithms, in the senses of both running time and overall accuracy. 2SNP is one of the fastest haplotype phasing algorithms with comparable low error rates with the other algorithms. The most time-consuming step of 2SNP is the construction of a maximum spanning tree ({MST}) among all the heterozygous {SNP} pairs. We simplified this step by replacing the {MST} with the initial haplotypes of adjacent heterozygous {SNP} pairs. The multi-{SNP} haplotypes were estimated within a sliding window along the chromosomes. The comparative studies on four different-scale genotype datasets suggest that our algorithm {WinHAP} outperforms 2SNP and most of the other haplotype phasing algorithms in terms of both running speeds and overall accuracies. To facilitate the {WinHAP}âs application in more practical biological datasets, we released the software for free at: http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/{\textasciitilde}xuyun/winhap/index.htm.},

Because of substantial discordance among calls made by existing sequencing methods and algorithms, there is a need for a highly accurate set of genotypes across a genome that can be used as a benchmark. Here we present methods to make high-confidence, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), indel and homozygous reference genotype calls for NA12878, the pilot genome for the Genome in a Bottle Consortium. We minimize bias toward any method by integrating and arbitrating between 14 data sets from five sequencing technologies, seven read mappers and three variant callers. We identify regions for which no confident genotype call could be made, and classify them into different categories based on reasons for uncertainty. Our genotype calls are publicly available on the Genome Comparison and Analytic Testing website to enable real-time benchmarking of any method.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: The goal of the haplotype assembly problem is to reconstruct the two haplotypes (chromosomes) for an individual using a mix of sequenced fragments from the two chromosomes. This problem has been shown to be computationally intractable for various optimization criteria. Polynomial time algorithms have been proposed for restricted versions of the problem. In this article, we consider the haplotype assembly problem in the most general setting, i.e. fragments of any length and with an arbitrary number of gaps.
Results: We describe a novel combinatorial approach for the haplotype assembly problem based on computing max-cuts in certain graphs derived from the sequenced fragments. Levy et al. have sequenced the complete genome of a human individual and used a greedy heuristic to assemble the haplotypes for this individual. We have applied our method HapCUTto infer haplotypes from this data and demonstrate that the haplotypes inferred using HapCUT are significantly more accurate (20â25\% lower maximum error correction scores for all chromosomes) than the greedy heuristic and a previously published method, Fast Hare. We also describe a maximum likelihood based estimator of the absolute accuracy of the sequence-based haplotypes using population haplotypes from the International HapMap project.
Availability: A program implementing HapCUT is available on request.

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Haplotypes play a crucial role in genetic analysis and have many applications such as gene disease diagnoses, association studies, ancestry inference and so forth. The development of {DNA} sequencing technologies makes it possible to obtain haplotypes from a set of aligned reads originated from both copies of a chromosome of a single individual. This approach is often known as haplotype assembly. Exact algorithms that can give optimal solutions to the haplotype assembly problem are highly demanded. Unfortunately, previous algorithms for this problem either fail to output optimal solutions or take too long time even executed on a {PC} cluster. Results: We develop an approach to finding optimal solutions for the haplotype assembly problem under the minimum-error-correction ({MEC}) model. Most of the previous approaches assume that the columns in the input matrix correspond to (putative) heterozygous sites. This all-heterozygous assumption is correct for most columns, but it may be incorrect for a small number of columns. In this article, we consider the {MEC} model with or without the all-heterozygous assumption. In our approach, we first use new methods to decompose the input read matrix into small independent blocks and then model the problem for each block as an integer linear programming problem, which is then solved by an integer linear programming solver. We have tested our program on a single {PC} [a Linux (x64) desktop {PC} with i7-3960X {CPU}], using the filtered {HuRef} and the {NA} 12878 datasets (after applying some variant calling methods). With the all-heterozygous assumption, our approach can optimally solve the whole {HuRef} data set within a total time of 31 h (26 h for the most difficult block of the 15th chromosome and only 5 h for the other blocks). To our knowledge, this is the first time that {MEC} optimal solutions are completely obtained for the filtered {HuRef} dataset. Moreover, in the general case (without the all-heterozygous assumption), for the {HuRef} dataset our approach can optimally solve all the chromosomes except the most difficult block in chromosome 15 within a total time of 12 days. For both of the {HuRef} and {NA}12878 datasets, the optimal costs in the general case are sometimes much smaller than those in the all-heterozygous case. This implies that some columns in the input matrix (after applying certain variant calling methods) still correspond to false-heterozygous sites.

These results concern the combinatorial problem of reconstructing haplotypes from incomplete and/or imperfectly sequenced haplotype fragments. We consider the complexity of the problems Minimum Error Correction (MEC) and Longest Haplotype Reconstruction (LHR) for different restrictions on the input data. Specifically, we look at the gapless case, where every row of the input corresponds to a gapless haplotype-fragment, and the 1-gap case, where at most one gap per fragment is allowed. We prove that MEC is APX-hard in the 1-gap case and still NP-hard in the gapless case. In addition, we question earlier claims that MEC is NP-hard even when the input matrix is restricted to being completely binary. Concerning LHR, we show that this problem is NP-hard and APX-hard in the 1-gap case (and thus also in the general case), but is polynomial time solvable in the gapless case.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Haplotype inference is an important step for many types of analyses of genetic variation in the human genome. Traditional approaches for obtaining haplotypes involve collecting genotype information from a population of individuals and then applying a haplotype inference algorithm. The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies allows for an alternative strategy to obtain haplotypes by combining sequence fragments. The problem of âhaplotype assemblyâ is the problem of assembling the two haplotypes for a chromosome given the collection of such fragments, or reads, and their locations in the haplotypes, which are pre-determined by mapping the reads to a reference genome. Errors in reads significantly increase the difficulty of the problem and it has been shown that the problem is {NP}-hard even for reads of length 2. Existing greedy and stochastic algorithms are not guaranteed to find the optimal solutions for the haplotype assembly problem. Results: In this article, we proposed a dynamic programming algorithm that is able to assemble the haplotypes optimally with time complexity O(m Ã 2k Ã n), where m is the number of reads, k is the length of the longest read and n is the total number of {SNPs} in the haplotypes. We also reduce the haplotype assembly problem into the maximum satisfiability problem that can often be solved optimally even when k is large. Taking advantage of the efficiency of our algorithm, we perform simulation experiments demonstrating that the assembly of haplotypes using reads of length typical of the current sequencing technologies is not practical. However, we demonstrate that the combination of this approach and the traditional haplotype phasing approaches allow us to practically construct haplotypes containing both common and rare variants.

  Abstract                 = {Inference of haplotypes, or the sequence of alleles along each chromosome, is a fundamental problem in genetics and is important for many analyses, including admixture mapping, identifying regions of identity by descent, and imputation. Traditionally, haplotypes are inferred from genotype data obtained from microarrays using information on population haplotype frequencies inferred from either a large sample of genotyped individuals or a reference dataset such as the {HapMap}. Since the availability of large reference datasets, modern approaches for haplotype phasing along these lines are closely related to imputation methods. When applied to data obtained from sequencing studies, a straightforward way to obtain haplotypes is to first infer genotypes from the sequence data and then apply an imputation method. However, this approach does not take into account that alleles on the same sequence read originate from the same chromosome. Haplotype assembly approaches take advantage of this insight and predict haplotypes by assigning the reads to chromosomes in such a way that minimizes the number of conflicts between the reads and the predicted haplotypes. Unfortunately, assembly approaches require very high sequencing coverage and are usually not able to fully reconstruct the haplotypes. In this work, we present a novel approach, Hap-seq, which is simultaneously an imputation and assembly method that combines information from a reference dataset with the information from the reads using a likelihood framework. Our method applies a dynamic programming algorithm to identify the predicted haplotype, which maximizes the joint likelihood of the haplotype with respect to the reference dataset and the haplotype with respect to the observed reads. We show that our method requires only low sequencing coverage and can reconstruct haplotypes containing both common and rare alleles with higher accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art imputation methods.},

Yet, despite this growth, mainstream technologies have not been fully able to resolve the diploid nature of the human genome. Here we describe statistically aided, long-read haplotyping ({SLRH}), a rapid, accurate method that uses a statistical algorithm to take advantage of the partially phased information contained in long genomic fragments analyzed by short-read sequencing. For a human sample, as little as 30 Gbp of additional sequencing data are needed to phase genotypes identified by 50Ã coverage whole-genome sequencing. Using {SLRH}, we phase 99\% of single-nucleotide variants in three human genomes into long haplotype blocks 0.2â1 Mbp in length. We apply our method to determine allele-specific methylation patterns in a human genome and identify hundreds of differentially methylated regions that were previously unknown. {SLRH} should facilitate population-scale haplotyping of human genomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) are the most frequent form of human genetic variation. They are of fundamental importance for a variety of applications including medical diagnostic and drug design. They also provide the highest-resolution genomic fingerprint for tracking disease genes. This paper is devoted to algorithmic problems related to computational {SNPs} validation based on genome assembly of diploid organisms. In diploid genomes, there are two copies of each chromosome. A description of the {SNPs} sequence information from one of the two chromosomes is called {SNPs} haplotype. The basic problem addressed here is the Haplotyping, i.e., given a set of {SNPs} prospects inferred from the assembly alignment of a genomic region of a chromosome, find the maximally consistent pair of {SNPs} haplotypes by removing data âerrorsâ related to {DNA} sequencing errors, repeats, and paralogous recruitment. In this paper, we introduce several versions of the problem from a computational point of view. We show that the general {SNPs} Haplotyping Problem is {NP}-hard for mate-pairs assembly data, and design polynomial time algorithms for fragment assembly data. We give a network-flow based polynomial algorithm for the Minimum Fragment Removal Problem, and we show that the Minimum {SNPs} Removal problem amounts to finding the largest independent set in a weakly triangulated graph.},

  Abstract                 = {The human genome is diploid, which requires assigning heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the two copies of the genome. The resulting haplotypes, lists of SNPs belonging to each copy, are crucial for downstream analyses in population genetics. Currently, statistical approaches, which are oblivious to direct read information, constitute the state-of-the-art. Haplotype assembly, which addresses phasing directly from sequencing reads, suffers from the fact that sequencing reads of the current generation are too short to serve the purposes of genome-wide phasing. While future-technology sequencing reads will contain sufficient amounts of SNPs per read for phasing, they are also likely to suffer from higher sequencing error rates. Currently, no haplotype assembly approaches exist that allow for taking both increasing read length and sequencing error information into account. Here, we suggest WhatsHap, the first approach that yields provably optimal solutions to the weighted minimum error correction problem in runtime linear in the number of SNPs. WhatsHap is a fixed parameter tractable (FPT) approach with coverage as the parameter. We demonstrate that WhatsHap can handle datasets of coverage up to 20Ã, and that 15Ã are generally enough for reliably phasing long reads, even at significantly elevated sequencing error rates. We also find that the switch and flip error rates of the haplotypes we output are favorable when comparing them with state-of-the-art statistical phasers.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Haplotype assembly is the computational problem of reconstructing haplotypes in diploid organisms and is of fundamental importance for characterizing the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the expression of phenotypic traits. Haplotype assembly highly benefits from the advent of âfuture-generationâ sequencing technologies and their capability to produce long reads at increasing coverage. Existing methods are not able to deal with such data in a fully satisfactory way, either because accuracy or performances degrade as read length and sequencing coverage increase or because they are based on restrictive assumptions.
Results: By exploiting a feature of future-generation technologiesâthe uniform distribution of sequencing errorsâwe designed an exact algorithm, called HapCol, that is exponential in the maximum number of corrections for each single-nucleotide polymorphism position and that minimizes the overall error-correction score. We performed an experimental analysis, comparing HapCol with the current state-of-the-art combinatorial methods both on real and simulated data. On a standard benchmark of real data, we show that HapCol is competitive with state-of-the-art methods, improving the accuracy and the number of phased positions. Furthermore, experiments on realistically simulated datasets revealed that HapCol requires significantly less computing resources, especially memory. Thanks to its computational efficiency, HapCol can overcome the limits of previous approaches, allowing to phase datasets with higher coverage and without the traditional all-heterozygous assumption.
